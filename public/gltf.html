    <h1>Art 109 Three.js GLTF Model Loader</h1>
    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is an example of a three.js scene that makes use of a GLTF 3D model.
      I chose this loader because GLTF/GLB models are the preferred format for
      online 3D model display. <br />
      <br />This example uses server side versions of the core Three.js, GLTF
      Loader and Orbit Control scripts. Documentation for loading 3D models in
      Three.js can be viewed at:<br />

      To add models and textures you will need to add them to your site. In the
      case of this example, I added the model to the assests section of glitch.
      For the scripts, I added them to the public folder of my server.
